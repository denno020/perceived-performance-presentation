          Performance will be different between each of your projects, but what
          we do know is that
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ðŸ–±Performance can be measured</p>
        <p>We can set up performance budgets</p>
        <p>We can run those Lighthouse audits as part of our build pipelines</p>
        <p>
          We can optimise, code split, lazy load, compress and minify our code
        </p>
        <p>
          We can monitor all of this using tools like Sentry, New Relic or many
          others
        </p>
        <p>So we can get a very good idea when our websites are performant</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now, can we get into a situation where all of our performance
          measurements indicate that a site should be really ðŸ–± fast, but when we
          actually use the site, ðŸ–± it feels slow?
        </p>
        <p>
          We could have a statically built site that accepts user interaction
        </p>
        <p>
          Being statically built will go a long way to acing the Lighthouse
          audit, but that's only for cold visits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a user has loaded their first web page, and starts to interact
          with the site, a lot of that performance work is less relevant
        </p>
        <p>
          In an SPA, after that first render, where a site feels fast or not is
          mostly dependent on the users network connection, and the load on the
          server
        </p>
        <p>If the connection is slow, API calls will take longer to resolve</p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if the server is under high stress, it will take longer to
          process those requests
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of these factors are going to give the user an impression of a
          slow website, regardless of how close we get Lighthouse to 100 for the
          performance metric
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we can control what we can control, like optimising our servers
          and adding caching layers, but the response time is never going to be
          instant
        </p>
        <p>We can make it feel instant though</p>
