        Before we get into the patterns, I want to quickly explain the demo
        website that we're going ot be enhancing throughout the presentation
      </li>
      <li>The demo app is all hosted on my machine ðŸ–±, including the server.</li>
      <li>
        The app is rendered using ReactðŸ–± , however all the enhancements we're
        going to make are done using ðŸ–± vanilla JS
      </li>
      <li>
        The reason for this is because the actual code implementation of the
        patterns isn't the important part of the talk, so I wanted to show that
        it's not reliant on any frameworks
      </li>
      <li>
        As all code is on my machine, that means that network requests would be instant, so I've added a slight
        delay into the server code to replicate a delay that would be felt if we
        were actually hitting the Internet and waiting for a response
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ–± That delay is 250ms</li>
      <li>
        Using frameworks might make some of this raw code simpler, but I'll
        leave that up to you to play around with in your specific stacks
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ–± Let me show you how the demo app currently works</li>
    </ul>
