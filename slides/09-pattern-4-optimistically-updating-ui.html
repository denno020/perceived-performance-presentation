        Our transition between the category page and product page is pretty
        instantaneous now
      </li>
      <li>Our users are going to be very happy</li>
      <li>
        But what about when they add a product to cart, what does that
        experience look like?
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º Looking back at the demo website, we can see that upon clicking on the
        Add to Cart button, the user has to wait for that API request to
        complete, before they can be sure that the item is added to cart, and
        then continue on with their shopping
      </li>
      <li>
        Why don't we go ahead and give them that confidence to continue shopping
        right away
      </li>
      <li>
        The final perceived performance pattern I would like to touch on is
        optimistically updating our UI
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimistically being the operative word - ðŸ–±  assume everything is going to
        go perfectly according to plan on the server
      </li>
      <li>
        If we assume that, then in the example of adding an item to cart, we can
        ðŸ–± manually edit our local state to make it look like the item is already
        added
      </li>
      <li>
        This gives the user immediate feedback, allowing them to go find another
        product, or go straight to the checkout
      </li>
      <li>
        Let's have a look at the updated experience with optimistic UI updating
        implemented
      </li>
      <li
        >Notice how the user can now go from looking through a list of products,
        right through to having an item in cart, and not have had to wait for
        anything to load at any point?
      </li>
      <li>I think this is a pretty great experience</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ–± We should talk about the potential pitfalls to optimistically updating
        the UI
      </li>
      <li>The most obvious one being, what happens if the action fails? ðŸ–± </li>
      <li>
        What happens if, in this example, the item isn't added to cart on the
        server?
      </li>
      <li>
        This is entirely possible - maybe there isn't any stock available for
        that product, maybe there weren't enough options selected, or maybe
        there was just some sort of internal server error
      </li>
      <li>
        In all of these instances, we'll need to provide a notice to the user
        that the item hasn't been successfully added to cart, and update the UI
        to remove our optimistically added product
      </li>
      <li>
        For the most part, I would expect these situations to be the exception
        rather than the rule, but if there is the possibility that it might
        happen to one user, then it's best to build a way to handle it
      </li>
    </ul>
