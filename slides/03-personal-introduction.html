      <li>Before I go too much further, I would like to introduce myself</li>
      <li>My name is Luke Denton</li>
      <li>I'm the Principal Frontend Software Engineer at Aligent</li>
      <!-- @TODO uncomment the following for the actual talk at the conference, don't need it for the office run through -->
      <!--      <li>And this is my first talk at a big conference, so the buutterflies are going crazy right now</li>-->
      <li>
        At Aligent, we build ecommerce websites for clients with customers both
        nationally and internationally
      </li>
      <li>
        Performance at scale is something that is very important to use and our
        clients
      </li>
      <li>
        For example, we have clients who regularly have X number of concurrent
        users, which really tests the infrastructure and performance of those
        sites
      </li>
      <li>
        Today I'm going to be sharing some patterns that we use in our ecom
        sites to ensure a users' experience is as best as it can be
      </li>
