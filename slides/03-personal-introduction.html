      <li>Before I go too much further, I would like to introduce myself</li>
      <li>ðŸ–±My name is Luke Denton</li>
      <li>ðŸ–±I'm a software engineer on the ðŸ–± NCP Core team</li>
      <li>
        Previously, I was the Principal Frontend Software Engineer at Aligent.
        Aligent are an ecommerce agency, building PWA's using React on top of
        Magento, Shopify, Big Commerce and others.
      </li>
      <li>
        There I was responsible for all things Frontend: hiring, mentoring,
        prototyping, fire fighting etc. One of the things that I often had to
        help project teams with was peformance concerns from clients regarding
        their ecommerce websites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Performance was a big part of my role, ensuring that we were able to
        extract the best perf for a clients website, but that didn't always mean
        raw numbers, which usually took a lot of convincing for a client to
        understand.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm going to be drawing on that experience to share some patterns that
        work in an ecommerce context, but are just as applicable in other
        contexts, maybe even more so a web app context, like NCP.
