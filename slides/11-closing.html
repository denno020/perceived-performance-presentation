      <li>ðŸ–± I just wanted to call out that all of these perception improvements were done in browser</li>
      <li>The server delay wasn't adjusted, simply choosing to load things a little bit earlier makes our website feel like a native app</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ–± These aren't the only ways to improve perceived performance, they are
        techniques that have been serving us well
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ–± My hope with this presentation is to give you a little bit of
        inspiration, and maybe alter your focus a little bit from raw
        performance metrics, to what the user is actually experiencing
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ–± These patterns aren't going to directly help with SEO, or core web
        vitals, but that's not the point of these improvements
      </li>
      <li>
        In saying that, if Google starts seeing that visitors to your site are
        converting at higher numbers, that will give it the impression of a high
        value site, and high value sites are displayed at the top of search
        results
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ–± Thank you all for listening</li>
