        These aren't the only ways to improve perceived performance, they are
        techniques that have been serving us well
      </li>

        My hope with this presentation is to give you a little bit of
        inspiration, and maybe alter your focus a little bit from raw
        performance metrics, to what the user is actually experiencing
      </li>
      <li>
        These patterns aren't going to directly help with SEO, or core web
        vitals, but that's not the point of these improvements

        In saying that, if Google starts seeing that visitors to your site are
        converting at higher numbers, that will give it the impression of a high
        value site, and high value sites are displayed at the top of search
        results

      <li>Thank you all for listening</li>
