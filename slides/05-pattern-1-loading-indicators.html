        The first pattern I want to talk about are loading indicators, more
        specifically, ðŸ–± not using loading indicators, ðŸ–± well using them
        sparingly
      </li>
      <li>
        Conventional wisdom would say that loading indicators are required, and
        they are, but the overuse of them will lead to a perception of a slow
        website
      </li>
      <li>Let's do a comparison</li>
      <li>
        First, let's look again at our demo website and focus on one specific
        transition
      </li>
      <li>
        When I click on a product on the category page, we are taken to the next
        view immediately, with a loading indicator being displayed to show that
        data is being loaded
      </li>
      <li>
        Feels pretty fast, even with the added server delay, no reason to think
        that it would be perceived as slow
      </li>
      <li>Users know exactly what is happening at all times</li>
      <li>
        One issue that we can see as a quick aside is there is a lot of movement
        as things are loaded in
      </li>
      <li>
        Notice that the footer starts pushed right up against the loading
        indicator, and there is all this white space below the footer?
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm sure I'm not along in saying this behaviour is seen very often
        online
      </li>
      <li>
        This layout jank will give the user the perception of poor performance
      </li>
      <li>
        We could fix that by using CSS to give out website 100% height, then
        push the footer to the bottom of the viewport, but even then, we still
        see the whole footer and then we don't, it gets pushed out of the
        viewport
      </li>
      <li>It's a jarring experience</li>
      <li>
        An improved pattern would be to use a skeleton loading UI, or simply
        pushing the footer below the fole while content is loading.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's unlikely that a page will be shorter than the viewport height of
        the users device, so by not showing the footer as content is loading,
        the user doesn't see things jumping all over the place, which makes the
        site feel much more performant
      </li>
      <li>Now, let's have a look at this next example</li>
      <li>
        We have the same code, but we're not displaying a loading indicator
      </li>
      <li>
        In this demo, I click on a product and then the very next thing that I
        see, is that product
      </li>
      <li>Did I have to wait? Did I perceive that I had to wait?</li>
      <li>Which one feels faster?</li>
      <li>This is exactly the situation we had with one of our clients</li>
      <li>
        They were comparing their website (that we built) with a competitors
        website, and saying that the competitors was faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        We were using a loading indicator as a result of all interactions where
        a user does have to wait
      </li>
      <li>The competitors website wasn't</li>
      <li>
        Even though, looking at the raw numbers, the rquests in the website we
        built were resolving just as fast, and sometimes faster, the client felt
        that their site was slower, because they could see exatly when they were
        being made to wait
      </li>
      <li>
        The issue that we had with the competitors implemenation, and the reason
        we didn't want to go the same route, is that when a user clicks, nothing
        actually happens until the network request resolves.
      </li>
      <li>
        As I'm using everything locally now, we're onlly waiting fo rthe forced
        quarter second delay, but what if we were on a slower connection, where
        the request did take a few more moments to respond?
      </li>
      <li>Or what if the user was on lie-fi?</li>
      <li>
        They would click a link, and then see that nothing happens, so they
        wouldn't think that the website was working
      </li>
      <li>
        They would likely click the link again, and again. Potentially creating
        multiple requests for the same thing, using up bandwidth, but almost
        certainly registering a rage click event in your analytics
      </li>
      <li>
        So loading indicators are essential, but they can also be overused and
        result in a perception of poor performance
      </li>
      <li>
        As loading indicators, indicate loading, they can make an app feel
        slower because the user see's exactly when they're being made to wait..
      </li>
      <li>
        Could we combine both approaches and have the best of both worlds?
      </li>
      <li>
        In this combined example, we don't display a loading indicator until
        after the user has been waiting for a period of time
      </li>
      <li>
        For users that have a fast connectoin, they won't see a loading
        indicator
      </li>
      <li>
        For users on a slow connection, they will see the loading indicator
        after 500ms, so they'll know that the website has received their input,
        and is currently processing it
      </li>
      <li>
        The 500ms timeout is an arbitrary value, it's really up to your
        situation what value you choose
      </li>
      <li>Let me quickly demonstrate by throttling my network connection</li>
    </ul>
