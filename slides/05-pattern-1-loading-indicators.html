        The first actual pattern I want to talk about are loading indicators, more
        specifically, ðŸ–± not using loading indicators, ðŸ–± well using them
        sparingly
      </li>
      <li>
        Conventional wisdom would say that loading indicators are required, and
        they are, but the overuse of them will lead to a perception of a slow
        website
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ–±Let's do a comparison</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º First, let's look again at our demo website and focus on one specific
        transition
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º When I click on a product on the category page, we are taken to the next
        view immediately, with a loading indicator being displayed to show that
        data is being loaded
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º Feels pretty fast, even with the added server delay, no reason to think
        that it would be perceived as slow
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ“º Users know exactly what is happening at all times</li>
      <li>ðŸ“º Now, let's have a look at this next example (Demo 3)</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º We have the same code, but we're not displaying a loading indicator
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º In this demo, I click on a product and then the very next thing that I
        see, is that product
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ“º Did I have to wait? Did I perceive that I had to wait?</li>
      <li>ðŸ“º Which one feels faster?</li>
      <li>ðŸ“º This is exactly the situation we had with one of our clients</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º They were comparing their website (that we built) with a competitors
        website, and saying that the competitors was faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º We were using a loading indicator as a result of all interactions where
        a user does have to wait
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ“º The competitors website wasn't</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º Even though, looking at the raw numbers, the rquests in the website we
        built were resolving just as fast, and sometimes faster, the client felt
        that their site was slower, because they could see exatly when they were
        being made to wait
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º The issue that we had with the competitors implementation, and the reason
        we didn't want to go the same route, is that when a user clicks, nothing
        actually happens until the network request resolves.
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º As I'm using everything locally now, we're only waiting for the forced
        quarter second delay, but what if we were on a slower connection, where
        the request did take a few more moments to respond?
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ“º Or what if the user was on lie-fi?</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º They would click a link, and then see that nothing happens, so they
        wouldn't think that the website was working
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º They would likely click the link again, and again. Potentially creating
        multiple requests for the same thing, using up bandwidth, but almost
        certainly registering a rage click event in your analytics
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ–± So that's what I mean when I say that the overuse of loading indicators can give the perception
        of poor performance, because users know exactly when they're being made to wait
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ–± Could we combine both approaches and have the best of both worlds? ðŸ–±
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ“º Let me demonstrate by throttling my network connection</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º In this combined example, we don't display a loading indicator until
        after the user has been waiting for a period of time
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º For users that have a fast connectoin, they won't see a loading
        indicator
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º For users on a slow connection, they will see the loading indicator
        after 500ms, so they'll know that the website has received their input,
        and is currently processing it
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º The 500ms timeout is an arbitrary value, it's really up to your
        situation what value you choose
      </li>
      
    </ul>
