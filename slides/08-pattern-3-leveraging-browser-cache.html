        We've enhanced our app to make loading a product page nearly feel
        instantaneous
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ–± The image is clearly coming in late though</li>
      <li>
        ðŸ“º We've decided against pre-fetching images, because we don't want to
        potentially waste a users bandwidth, ðŸ–± so how can we make the image feel
        instant?
      </li>
      <li>Well that's where we can lean on the browser cache</li>
      <li>
        The browser has already seen an image for this product, on the category
        page
      </li>
      <li>
        Why don't we just re-use that exact image as a placeholder for the
        product page, while the main, high resolution image is being downloaded?
      </li>
      <li>
        This technique is incredibly simple, all we have to do is request the
        same image path that we requested when on the category page, and the
        browser will automatically use the image that is stored in cache
      </li>
      <li>ðŸ–± Demo (6)</li>
      <li>Downsides?</li>
      <li>
        There's only two that I can think of, depending on the resolution of
        image that is required on the product page, the cached mage that is
        displayed as a placeholder could appear pixelated
      </li>
      <li>
        This isn't that big of a deal thought, as it would just appear like a
        progressively loaded JPG, with the benefit of holding the vertical space
        for the high resolution image to come in
      </li>
      <li>
        Another potential issue is if the main image used on your product page
        is different to the image used on the category page
      </li>
      <li>
        Where in your control, I would advise against doing this, though, as it
        could confuse users
      </li>
