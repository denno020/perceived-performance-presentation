        As an extension of loading indicators, I want to talk about local data
        cache
      </li>
      <li>
        Now they aren't really related, however the uer of local data cache will
        mean that we can prevent our users from having to see loading indicators
        more than necessary
      </li>
      <li>
        and by introducing it now, I can bridge the gap to the patterns we'll
        talk about in a few minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Local data cache is simply remembering what the user has already seen,
        and never showing a loading indicator in those contexts again
      </li>
      <li>Let's refer back to our demo app again</li>
      <li>
        First, I click on a product on the category page, the API request is
        fired off to get the product information, then when a response is
        returned, we'll render that product data
      </li>
      <li>
        If I then press the back button, and select the exact same product,
        notice how we're waiting for the product data to download again?
      </li>
      <li>
        We did also see a loading indicator for the category page, to show
        products that we're already seen
      </li>
      <li>
        There's no need for either of those loading indicators, we should be
        able to immediately render the same product data that we've already
        downloaded, and then in the background, send off the APi request to get
        updated product information, which we can then choose to render to the
        UI or just update our cache value
      </li>
      <li>
        This is the stale-while-revalidate pattern that you might have heard
        before
      </li>
      <li>
        In my day-to-day working on ecommerce websites, we use Apollo Client,
        which automatically handles caching data, serving up that data from
        cache when it's requested, and also updating the cache and pushing
        updated values to render to the UI, so it's super easy to take advantage
        of this pattern
      </li>
      <li>
        In this next interaction of the demo website, however, I'm not using
        Apollo or any other libraries, but rather I've simply written something
        with vanilla JS, using in memory cache
      </li>
      <li>
        As we can see, the first time that we navigate to the product page, we
        do wait a moment for the request to resolve, but the second, third or
        any other time in the future, we see the product data instantly
      </li>
      <li>
        The user doesn't need to wait again, and because we're still making the
        same API request to get the product data, they won't be stuck with stale
        data
      </li>
      <li>
        Local data cache can either be the method I just used, store all in
        memory, meaning if a user leaves the website and comes back, or maually
        refreshes the page, all of that cache is cleared
      </li>
      <li>or persisted onto the users device</li>
      <li>
        Persistent is a great idea, because it gives return visitors immediate
        perceived performance, but we do have to factor in things like available
        storage on the users device
      </li>
      <li>
        We're not storing compressed data, meaning the space on disk can't be
        minimised like it is within the network transfer to download the dta, so
        we have to be wary to pick a technology that affords us enough space
      </li>
      <li>
        The obvious options would be localStorage or sessionStorage, but be
        aware that there is a limit of only around 5mb that can be stored in
        these locations
      </li>
      <li>
        A better approach could actually be IndexedDB, or if you have a service
        worker installed, the Cache API, both of which have access to much, much
        more storage space
      </li>
    </ul>
